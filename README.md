Introduction:

Organizations working in sectors such as financial services, risk & compliance, consulting, or research are often challenged with data wrangling tasks. On average, their employees spend two and a half hours every day looking for the data they are seeking. With the businesses and competition in almost each and every industry growing multifold every year, this process is supposed to become even more time-consuming, expensive, and most importantly error-prone. One valid reason behind this is that key data measures are often not already stored in the organizationsâ€™ relational databases but published in various formats online and offline such as PDF, DOC, JPEG, etc. These documents usually include various kinds of financial documents such as accounting tables, price indices, investment details, records of credit history, etc., which prevent easy extraction of relevant information. Employing man-force to accomplish the task of data wrangling from thousands of documents seems like a cumbersome task.
